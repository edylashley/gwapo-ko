- Engineer assignment bug (fix when project eng. already, cant be a team member)
- Add editable and deleteable salary modal for each team member detailed engineering description

- Adjust project cards sizes for less screen space consumption


- after adding project/after adding expense, when closing the modal, it should add directly to the project page without refreshing the page

- when removing an engineer from the team assignment page, the value of detailed engineering from the track record should be updated
